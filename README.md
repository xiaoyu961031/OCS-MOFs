Welcome to the repository containing the code to reproduce the optimal models for predicting CO2 uptake and log-scaled CO2/CH4 selectivity in open copper site metal-organic frameworks (OCS-MOFs). This repository is intended to provide an easy and transparent way for researchers to replicate and build upon the findings presented in our study.

To execute the code, you will need to download the required datasets: log_selectivity_data.csv and uptake_data.csv from Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/13937049. These datasets contain the processed features and target variables essential for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

The repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, employing diversity-adaptable machine learning techniques to ensure model robustness across distinct chemical spaces. The models aim to optimize CO2 uptake and selectivity in OCS-MOFs, providing valuable insights into how to design efficient materials for gas separation.
